One way to achieve this is to break the function up into smaller chunks, and run them bit by bit by `setTimeout`.\r\n\r\n````js\r\nfunction slowOperation () {\r\n  // Some work here. ..\r\n  setTimeout(function part1 () {\r\n    // Some more work here ...\r\n    setTimeout(function part2 () {\r\n      // Some more work here ...\r\n      setTimeout(function part3 () {\r\n        // Even some more work here ...\r\n      }, 100)\r\n    }, 100)\r\n  }, 100)\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\nWith `aqueduct`, you can write the following without splitting up your function and wrapping them in `function () {}`.\r\n\r\n````js\r\nvar conduit = aqueduct.create({\r\n  interval: 100,\r\n});\r\nconduit.push(function* slowOperation () {\r\n  yield part1();\r\n  yield part2();\r\n  yield part3();\r\n});\r\nconduit.start();\r\n````\r\n\r\nIn this example, `part2` will be executed after 100ms after `part1` is completed.\r\n\r\nAn advantage of using `aqueduct` over `setTimeout`-based solution is that, you can **pause** the slow function by `conduit.stop()` and resume later `conduit.start()`, if you want to prioritize other processing.\r\n\r\n## Use cases\r\n\r\nOne real world use case scenario is to loading heavy content in an infinite scrolling web page. To prevent janky scrolling, use `conduit.push()` to append the items to the DOM, and call `conduit.pause()` to when the user starts scrolling. But of course, you should try to optimize with the techniques in http://jankfree.org/ first. (See `example/infinite-scroll.html`)\r\n\r\nAnother example is to improve responsiveness of slider-based web page. When the user starts touching the slider, pause all other slow functions by `conduit.pause` to make sure touch events can be emitted 60 FPS. (See `example/slider.html`)\r\n\r\n## API\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n## Limitation\r\n\r\nSince `aqueduct` relies on generator, you will have to transpile your ES6 code by something like [Traceur](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler) and [regenerator](https://github.com/facebook/regenerator).\r\n\r\n`aqueduct` is transpiled as `index.js` with [regenerator](https://github.com/facebook/regenerator) with the [runtime](https://github.com/facebook/regenerator/blob/master/runtime/dev.js). You might to use the source file in `src/aqueduct.js` and pass everthing through the transpiler instead.\r\n\r\n## Todo\r\n\r\n- Test with delegate yield\r\n- Test compatibility with thunk-style callback\r\n- Change start() to return thunk-style callback\r\n\r\n## Test\r\n\r\n- Use Karma\r\n- Require the harmony branch of Istanbul for code coverage\r\n- Travis integration\r\n\r\n## Reference and related projects\r\n\r\n- http://kangax.github.io/es5-compat-table/es6/#Generators_(yield)\r\n- http://airbnb.github.io/infinity/\r\n- https://github.com/visionmedia/co\r\n- https://gist.github.com/creationix/5762837\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nMIT\r\n","google":"UA-31474108-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
